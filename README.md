# Sunny Or Gloomy?

## Description
The Sunny or Gloomy webpage allows users to search a city and see the predicted forecast for the next 6 days. User will also receive details on humadity, wind speed and temperature for each day of forecast. This makes it easy and simple for user to search the weather in their area and the forecast for another city aswell.

When users click on the page, there will be a search form on the left side of the webpage. In the search bar, user type the name of a city and click search bar. The current weather conditions will be display in the top box at the center of the page.
